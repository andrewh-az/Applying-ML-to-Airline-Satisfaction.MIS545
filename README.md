# Applying-ML-to-Airline-Satisfaction.MIS545
This repository contains python code (.ipynb) applying various machine learning algorithms to a data set. The data is airline satisfaction survey data collected from passengers. The data has been cleaned for classification and machine learning purposes. 

Our workflow is as follows:
1. Initial Data Exploration
2. Feature Engineering
3. Preprocessing and Data Split
4. Feature Selection
5. Model Fitting
6. Hyperparameter Tuning
7. Model Evaluation and Selection
8. SHAP Analysis
9. Insights

This code was made with dynamic adjustment in mind. A user can change several variables, specifically for hyperparameter tuning, to experiment with the effectiveness of different models. The code fits three models: K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest Ensemble. Our team was trying to understand the necessary components of a flight experience for consistent satisfaction. 

This code was part of our final project for MIS 545 Data Mining for Business Intelligence, a course at the University of Arizona. 

The team members for the project are as follows:
- Andrew Holland
- Fawaaz Abdulazeez
- Osama Adel Ba Hamid
- Asad Tahir Quraishy
